## **UAV Cyber Threat Detection Dashboard**

### **Overview**:
The UAV Cyber Threat Detection Dashboard is a real-time monitoring and threat detection system for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). It uses machine learning models to identify potential cybersecurity threats, such as GPS Spoofing and GPS Jamming attacks, based on UAV signal data. The system is built using Streamlit for a real-time interactive user interface and Plotly for dynamic data visualization.

### **Dashboard Features**:
- **Real-Time Threat Detection**
  - Detects **GPS Spoofing** and **GPS Jamming** attacks in UAV GPS data.
  - Uses **Column Transfomer** for pre-processing incoming data.
  - Uses **Isolation Forest** for anomaly detection.
  - A **Random Forest Classifier** model identifies the specific type of threat.

- **Live Visualizations**
  - Real-time charts update as new data batches stream in.
  - Display of current signal status: **Benign** or **Malicious**.
  - Visual metrics for **Speed**, **Signal**, and **Noise** levels.

- **Threat Logs**
  - Timestamped logs of every detection event.
  - Logs downloadable as CSV files.

- **User Controls**
  - Start / Stop / Reset buttons for controlling the stream.
  - Adjustable **batch size** and **contamination threshold**.

- **Data Upload**
  - Upload your own UAV GPS dataset (CSV format) for analysis.

- **Theme Adaptive UI**
  - Custom-styled buttons, sliders, and components.
  - Automatically adapts to **dark or light mode**.

  - Top 10 features for **Random Forest Classifier** (Attack classification Model)


## üõ°Ô∏è Threat Analysis Page Workflow

The **Threat Analysis** page detects real-time UAV GPS threats using a structured approach:

#### 1. **Data Pre-processing**
   - Data is streamed in real-time from a CSV file.
   - It undergoes **pre-processing** to handle missing values, scaling, and transformations using a trained **ColumnTransformer**.
   - The pre-processed data is ready for anomaly detection.

#### 2. **Isolation Forest Detection**
   - The pre-processed data is passed to the **Isolation Forest** model.
   - **Anomalies** are detected. If the data point is classified as **malicious**, further classification occurs.
   - **Benign signals** are ignored in the next steps.

#### 3. **Attack Classification**
   - For **malicious signals**, a **Classifier** (e.g., Random Forest) determines whether the threat is a **Spoofing** or **Jamming** attack based on additional signal features.
   - **Spoofing** and **Jamming** are the two primary attack types detected by the classifier.

#### 4. **Real-Time Visualizations**
   - **Status boxes** show real-time counts of **Benign**, **Malicious**, **Spoofed**, and **Jammed** signals.
   - **Charts** dynamically update with each batch of data, highlighting the detection results and threat types.
   
#### 5. **Threat Logs**
   - **Logs** are generated with timestamps for each detection event (Benign/Malicious).
   - Users can **download these logs as CSV** files for further analysis.

#### 6. **Metrics Overview**
   - Continuous updates to **signal counts** are displayed for easy tracking of detection results (Benign, Malicious, Spoofed, Jammed).
